21. Discussion (20 marks) 
A computer   programmer that works   in the   payroll   department created   a   fake   employee number   and   entered   this   employee   into   the   payroll   database.   The   programmer   then   programmed the payroll   system to pay this fake employee and deposit the funds into one   of   their   own   bank   accounts.   Identify   at   least   2   control    procedures   that   could    have   prevented the problem, and explain why each of the controls would   have   helped. 
22. REA Diagram with Cardinality (20 marks) Assume that you own five apartments   in Dongqian Lake. Your   business   provides   holiday   apartment   rental   to   people who take short-term   holidays   in Dongqian Lake. This   is   your   main source of income. You   want   to   design   and   build   a   database to   keep   track   of   your   business. The following describes   how your business   is   running.The   first   thing   that   happens   in   your   business   is   that   one   customer   reserves   a   holiday   home   (i.e.   one   of your   five   apartments)   for   his/her   vacation   with   families   and   friends.   Reservations are made for specific days, and   each day   is   associated   with   a   specific   cost.   The entire rental   must be paid at the same time of   reservation.   Customers   then   come to   the   lake,   stay   in   the   holiday   home   and   enjoy   their   holiday.   Feedback   and   satisfaction   rating forms are available in the apartment; customers can fill out the form. if they would   like to or if they have any complaints when staying in the holiday   home.   After   customers   leave   the apartment, one of   your employees checks the apartment   and identifies   anything   that has been damaged. You keep a record of   the conditions of each apartment after each   rental   and   an   estimate   of the   repair costs   after   each   rental.   You   have three   employees   who   maintain, clean and check the condition of the apartments.
Note: assume that there are no   cancellation   cases.

Also,    briefly    describe    the    three      steps      involved      in   developing the REA diagram.
23. Table Normalisation (20 marks) 
Use the following attributes to create tables that meet all of the normalization rules. Note:   you do   not need to create any new attributes.

Required: 
Clearly   indicate   all   primary   and   foreign   keys   in   your   tables.   Use   the   following   notation.
Also,   briefly describe your steps   in normalizing this database.
•         Tables   in   (   )
•          Primary   keys Underline 
•          Foreign   keys   in Italics
